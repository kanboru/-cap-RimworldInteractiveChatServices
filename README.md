# Statement Regarding TwitchToolkit and CAP Chat Interactive

## Attribution and Acknowledgment

We acknowledge that CAP Chat Interactive was conceptually inspired by hodlhodl1132's original TwitchToolkit project. We have taken care to ensure proper attribution to the original work while implementing substantial architectural improvements.

## Important Clarification on Copyright

To address recent communications, we wish to clarify:

**SirRandoo is not the copyright holder of TwitchToolkit.** The original copyright belongs to hodlhodl1132. While we respect the contributions of all community members, copyright enforcement rights remain exclusively with the original author.

## Technical Distinctions

Our implementation represents a complete ground-up rewrite with significant architectural differences:

- **Platform-Based Identification**: Secure user identification using platform user IDs rather than spoofable usernames
- **Queue Management System**: Comprehensive queue with timestamps and fairness algorithms
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Extensible architecture supporting Twitch, YouTube, and other platforms
- **Enhanced Security**: Prevention of username spoofing through platform verification
- **Different Technical Stack**: .NET 4.7.2 implementation with distinct data persistence

## License Compliance

We are committed to full compliance with the GNU Affero GPL v3 license under which the original TwitchToolkit was released. All derivative elements are properly attributed, and our complete source code remains available as required by the license.

## Community Focus

As a community preservation effort, our goal is to maintain and improve upon abandoned mod code for the benefit of all RimWorld modding community members. We believe multiple implementations of similar concepts benefit users through choice and innovation.

We remain open to constructive dialogue with the actual copyright holder, hodlhodl1132, regarding any concerns about our implementation.
